Content
 
This is to be a website for my family fireworks that we do every single year. On the home page I would like some fireworks on the front with the logo in the middle as well. The two other pages should be called “Book a show”, where you can book a show and buy fireworks as well and an  “about us” page that better explains what our company is about. Make the front page as patriotic as could be, add monster trucks, bald eagles, explosives, anything you could really imagine to make it go BOOM! Carry this theme onto the “Book a Show” and “About Us” pages.
 
Add this picture to the “About Us” page as it is the people who started it all
